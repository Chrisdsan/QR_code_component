# QR Code Component

A responsive QR code component built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge.  
The goal of this project was to translate a static design into clean, semantic HTML and maintainable CSS while following modern frontend best practices.

## 🔍 Overview

This is a simple, pixel-accurate UI component that displays a QR code with supporting text.  
The focus of the project was **layout, spacing, typography, and responsiveness**, rather than JavaScript functionality.

## 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS (Flexbox)
- Mobile-first workflow

## 🎯 Key Implementation Details

- Used semantic HTML elements for accessibility and clarity
- Implemented a mobile-first layout to ensure responsiveness
- Leveraged Flexbox for clean alignment and centering
- Maintained consistent spacing and typography based on design specs
- Structured CSS for readability and scalability

## 📐 Layout & Responsiveness

The component is centered both vertically and horizontally and adapts cleanly across screen sizes.  
The layout maintains visual balance and readability on mobile and desktop viewports.
